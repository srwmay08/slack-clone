# React Messaging Single-Page App

## To-Do (Level 1)

* Create Multiple Users, and store the username along with each message.

## To-Do (Level 2)

* Make an "Add User" page and allow new users to register for the app.

* Store both messages and users. 

Hint: Use a flat file (just JSON.stringify() the data and write it into a file).

Hint 2: You're welcome to attempt to hook up a mongo db to the project (but that's a level 5 challenge!)

* Create Multiple Channels, and allow the user to select which "channels" they want to view. 

Hint: Each Message object should have a channel. When you request a specific channel, just filter for all of the messages that match that channel.

Hint 2: use a get query param to request specific channels

## To-Do (Level 3)

* Allow Users to upload profile pictures.
* Allow Users to send direct messages to another user


## To-Do (LEVEL 9001)

* Make it look good
* Make it look good on a phone
